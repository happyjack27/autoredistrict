democracy

one person one vote

is that true?


Are contiguency, compactness, and population balance sufficient to determine fair districts, on average?

NO.

scenario 1:
if the population is well mixed:
* majority party gets nearly ALL of the seats.
NO

show example of urban vs rural.

why does population density affect this?

how to measure?

one person one vote 
- each person gets about the same representation in congress
- each person has the same likilihood of altering an election outcome

 
- each person gets about the same representation in congress
  - proportional representation 
- each person has the same likilihood of altering an election outcome
  - voting power balance
  
  
  scoring
  
  how to score proportional representation?
  
  * develop a metric to measure the distribution of a population.
  for instance: % dem, % republican, % independant.
  * measure the distribution of a simulated election result, and the citizen population
  * construct a way to score the similarity.
  * multiple such ways
   - pearson correlation
   - kl-divergence. <- measures how much information is in the actual that is not in the model 
   
  
  now that we can score, how to design?
  
  candidates -> scores -> recombination -> mutation -> repeat
  
  general class of algorithms known as "heuristic optimization"
  
  a wonderful feature of heuristic optimization methods is that you do not need to know how to generate good solutions, 
  you only need to know how to score the quality of a solution! 
  
  scores -> generate new set based on old set and scores -> repeat
  
  heuristic:  using experience to learn and improve
  optimization: an act, process, or methodology of making something (as a design, system, or decision) as fully perfect, functional, or effective as possible; 
  specifically :  the mathematical procedures (as finding the maximum of a function) involved in this
  
  scores -> generate new set based on old set and scores -> repeat
  
  "genetic algorithm"
  
  candidates -> scores -> recombination -> mutation -> repeat

  what we did
  
  - broke it down into wards, got geometry, census, and election data for each word.
  
  - chose criteria to optimize:
  
  -----------
  
  recombination explores the solution set very quickly.
  
  try 33, 22, 11, 00, 
  11 is best, 00 is second best.
  okay, try re-combinations of these:
  
  try 11, 00, 10, 01,
  10 is best, 11 is second best.
  done.
  
  without recombination, we'd have to try each possibility individually, which is 4^2 = 16 combinations.
  with recombination we only had to try 8.
  recombination arrives at the solution twice as fast.
  
  what happens when we add more?  let's say we double the number of digits:
  it turns if we add another digit, without recombination we'd have to try 4^4 combinations = 64.
  but with recombination, we'd only have to try double the number of generations. = 8*2 = 16.
  now recombination arrives at the solution FOUR times as fast.
  
  as we add more digits, the advantage of recombination over checking each individual solution grows EXPONENTIALLY.
  
  mutation is added in to keep the variety of candidate solutions from getting too low.
  
  as we approach the solution, we can lower the amount of mutation. (this is known as "annealing".  analgous to slowly lowering the temperature of melted metal to help it form a more regular structure) 
  ----
  
  now let's say we only needed to get our solution in the top 25%.  that is, we only need to eliminate the 75% worst candidates.
  well each generation eliminates, on average, the same percentage of the population.
